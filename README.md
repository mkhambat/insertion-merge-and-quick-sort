# insertion-merge-and-quick-sort

My program picks up random numbers in batches of 180, 360, 540 ..... 3600 in a. Ascending order b. Descending order c. Random order and sorts it using merge sort, quick sort and insertion sort. The time taken by each algorithm to sort 180, 360, 540 ..... 3600 numbers is then ploted on a graph (running time vs input size) (grapgh.pdf file) to analyse and compare running time of all the 3 algorithms.
